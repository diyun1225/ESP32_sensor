Vin+ connects to the voltage source positive (+). Can be a battery or a power supply.

Vin- connects to the load. The INA219 will measure the current through this load. A load must always be connected,
NEVER connect this terminal to ground or a voltage source like a battery or you will destroy the INA219.

Grounds (GND): Connect ALL grounds together. Power source ground, load ground, INA219 ground, Arduino ground.
★If the measurements are inaccurate, it could be an issue with the load.
